  "scene_name": "Traditional Kazakh Family Meal",
  "scene_description": "Under the golden glow of sunrise, vast Kazakh steppes stretch endlessly, with snow-capped mountains on the horizon. A traditional Kazakh yurt stands at the center, smoke curling softly from its chimney. Inside the yurt, a family gathers around a low wooden table adorned with steaming plates of beshbarmak (boiled meat and noodles) and bowls of kymyz (fermented horse milk). In the foreground, hands gently slice kazy (horse sausage), while a pot simmers over an open fire outside. The ambiance is warm and inviting, with golden-hour lighting casting soft shadows. Captured in cinematic, slow motion, the scene highlights every detail—steam rising, the texture of the food, and the joy of sharing a communal meal.",
